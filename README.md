```python /home/your-name/BlueShell_Terminal/execute.py```

### UBUNTU/DEBIAN:
(Includes Debian Ports such as RaspberryPi OS)

```python /home/your-name/BlueShell_Terminal/execute.py```

## 2. CURRENT COMMANDS
Upon booting up the OS, you will see `Welcome to BlueShellOS. Would you like a list of every current command? [Y/N]`. (Note that this part is not case sensitive, ***but the rest of the OS is.***) Here, you can input either y or n, if you input anything else, the OS will interperite it as n.

If you enter n, it will skip to asking your name. If you enter y, it will list out the following:
```
BlueShell OS Version [version]
help - returns a list of every command
sys version - Returns OS version
sys clear --r - Reboots OS
sys clear --s - Turns off OS
sys clear --u - Updates OS
```
